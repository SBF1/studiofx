StudioFX is a graphical studio that can be used with Renjin, the JVM-based interpreter for the R language ( http://renjin.org )

This code currently an experiment in learning about R graphics, Renjin, and testing the possibility of adding graphics to Renjin.

The interface is divided into three regions:

At top left is a code editor (based on https://github.com/TomasMikula/RichTextFX )

At bottom left is a Console, based on existing code from Renjin

The right side of the display is a plotting region which uses code from https://github.com/brucejohnson/jfxplot
